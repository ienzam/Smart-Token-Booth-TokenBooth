SMART TOKEN BOOTH

Smart Token Booth system is a system to remove the queue from the places
where users need to stand in a line for any service.

The full solution needs a computer to act as server and each service
booth needs a small device to communicate with the server. Token counter
will also need to have a small device.

The most interesting and important feature is the whole system does not
need any wiring. All communications with server is done via radio
transmission. And it's easy to configure :-).

This is the token booth part (which resides on a microcontroller).
The code is written for AVR GCC compiler compatible.

This file needs three files - lcd.c, lcd.h and myutils.h. They are not free
